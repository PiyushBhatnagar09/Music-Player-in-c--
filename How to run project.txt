steps to run our DS MUSIC SYSTEM PROJECT :-
1. make codeblocks new project
2. paste our code in the main.cpp of that project folder
3. add Database, song, lyrics folder in the same folder as main.cpp
4. go to setting->compiler->linker setting, and add "-lwinmm" to play music otherwise the playmusic() function in our code will give error.

THANK YOU !!
